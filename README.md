GMTK Game Jam 2025 Submission Project:



This project is dedicated to Ema, Carleton, and my mom Kerry.



I will be creating an quick indie horror game, following a character as they explore the grief of a loved one through shared hobbies and memories as they hike around a mountain path inspired by the Tahoe Rim Trail. A trail that I have tried, and very nearly finished, backpacking through.



The project will be programmed in Godot 4.4.1 using GDScript.
